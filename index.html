      <h1><b>Education Loan: Single Window To Apply At Any Of The 34 Banks</b></h1>
      <h3><span><img src="latest.jpg" alt="Add by google" height="350" width="450"></span>If you have managed to procure the much sought-after offer letter from any Ivy League University or a top institution in India or abroad, there might be chances that you would need a bank loan to be able to fund the studies. To be able to do so, you can explore a single window solution of 'Vidya Lakshmi' to apply for any of the 34 banks at one place.

Vidya Lakshmi is a portal developed under the guidance of Department of Financial Services, (Ministry of Finance), Department of Higher Education (Ministry of Human Resource Development) and Indian Banks Association (IBA).

Applying for loan at this portal is a cakewalk. A student only needs to do the login, followed by filing up of Common Education Loan Application Form (CELAF). The CELAF is a single form that students can fill to be able to apply for educational loan to multiple banks. This is the form prescribed by Indian Banks Association (IBA) and hence, accepted by all banks.Some of the banks registered with Vidya Lakshmi are Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank, Bank of India, Canara Bank, Corporation Bank, IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank, Indian Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and Karur Vysya Bank, among others

Before applying, one can search for various loans on the portal and choose the offer depending on one's requirement. Then one can apply for a loan at any of the banks registered with Vidya Lakshmi. In case the loan gets rejected then the student can apply for two more banks out of the remaining list of 33 banks.</h3>

          <h3><span><img src="tecnology.jpg" alt="Add by google" height="350" width="450"></span>In what seems like a major hack on YouTube, several popular videos were deleted from the platform for a short while. Amongst the affected videos was Luis Fonsi’s Despacito (featuring Daddy Yankee) which incidentally became the most streamed video of all-time on YouTube. The video hit the 5-billion mark recently but was deleted for a brief period today. There were a lot of other videos of other artists including Shakira, Katy Perry, Maroon5 and Drake which were also hacked.<br>
According to various media reports, the hack showed a still on the video had several masked figures aiming guns at the camera. This wasn’t a part of the original video and when viewers tried to play the video, the message “the video is unavailable” flashed on the screen. The song title was also changed to “"Hacked by Prosox & Kuroi'SH & Shade & Akashi IT & KiraRoot & Xepher & SenpaiWeb & Misao”. However, when we checked later, the video is back online and playing absolutely fine. </h3><br>
